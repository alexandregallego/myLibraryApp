Sure, I can do that. Here is the README.md file for your code:

## MyLibrary

This is a simple Django project that allows users to create, edit, and delete books.

### Installation

To install this project, you will need to have Python and Django installed. Once you have those installed, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mylibrary.git
cd mylibrary
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the project

To run the project, you can use the following command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start the development server on port 8000. You can then access the project in your browser by visiting http://localhost:8000.

### Using the project

The project has two main pages: the home page and the books page. The home page displays a list of all the books in the database. The books page allows you to create, edit, and delete books.

To create a new book, click on the "Add Book" button on the books page. This will open a form where you can enter the title, author, and publication date of the book. Once you have entered the information, click on the "Save" button to create the book.

To edit a book, click on the "Edit" button next to the book. This will open a form where you can change the title, author, and publication date of the book. Once you have made the changes, click on the "Save" button to update the book.

To delete a book, click on the "Delete" button next to the book. This will delete the book from the database.
